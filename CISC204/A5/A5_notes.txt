PREDICATE SEMANTIC VALIDIDTY
------------------------------------------------
Compare:  |- THETA
Method: Proof
Proposition: |= THETA

For every row # i, THETA evaluates to T
For every Model M with (if we need it, a look up table) L, that all models (F, P) in THETA:
M |=_{L} THETA (the model is semantically entails - via L - THETA)

EXAMPLE:

|= (Ey.Ax.R(x,y) -> (Ax.Ey.R(x,y))) valid statement in natural deduction

Counter Example:

|/= (Ax.Ey.R(x,y) -> (Ey.Ax.R(x,y)) invalid statement in natural deduction


PREDICATE SEMANTIC CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------------------------
Consider: set G of formulas (THETA) in logic:

Proposition: in PROPOSITIONAL logic, 
suppose we build a truth table of all the formulas in G,
there exists a row # i in the table such that for every formula in G, the formula evaluates to T:
(of course, these are very simple examples as each Truth Table only has 1 row)

TT1:
P^Q, R 	is consistent

TT2:
P^Q, P^~Q     is not consistent


in PREDICATE logic we can say this as:
G is consistent is defined as:

There exists a Model M with a lookup L, such that:
for all THETA in G, we have M |=_{L} THETA

EXAMPLE:

Ex.P(x), Ey.~P(y)

Counter Example:

Ax.P(x), Ey.~P(y)

if you can prove the bottom symbol for 2 true premises, they may be inconsistent


PREDICATE CORRECTNESS & COMPLETENES
---------------------------------------------------------------
In a Meta-Logic (ie, Set Theory)
given a set of premesis G, THETA in G
formula PSI

Soundness: if G |- PSI
	 then G |= PSI

Method: structural induction on the length of the proof of G |- PSI


Completeness: shown in the PHD Thesis of Kurt Godel c.1929
	if G |=PSI
	then G |- PSI

Method: is suitably complicated for a PHD Thesis

Summary: G |- PSI IFF G |= PSI

Either: 	PSI is satisfiable
	or we can prove the negation of PSI (|- ~PSI)
