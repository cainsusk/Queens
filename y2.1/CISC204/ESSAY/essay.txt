summary:

the efficient movement of people throughout a city is 
one of the more difficult challenges faced by a metropolitan
government. there are many options for commuters 
(car, rail, bus, etc.), but we want to be able to model
the most efficient form of transport (with regards time and 
fuel consumption). Therefore, we will be modeling a public 
transit system and the shortest way to get from point A to 
point B within said system


propositions:

* C(x, y, z) 
  means x is a commuter starting from stop y, ending at stop z
* Met(x, y) 
  x is a metro line with y number of stops each numbered 
  from 1 to y
* Bus(x, y) 
  x is a bus line with y number of stops
* Leg()
* S(x, y, z) 
  means x is stop z on line y
* F(x, [Leg1, ..., legn]) 
  means the shortest route from x's start to end is Leg1-Legn
* Intr(x, [(y, ys), (z, zs), ..., (n, ns)) 
  x is stop ys on line y and stop xs on line x, thus meaning 
  you can transfer between y and z (to n) at stop x
* P(x) it is possible for commuter x to go from its starting 
  stop to its ending stop
* NP(x) it is not possible for commuter x to go from its 
  starting stop to its ending stop

(Met(r,9) ^ Met(b,5) ^ Stop(s,r,1) ^ Stop(e,b,5) ^ Intr(t,(r,9),(b,1))) ^ C(a,s,e) -> 

ok perhaps instaed of trying to find the fastets rout we 
could just model if it was possible to got from point
a to point b in the system. or maybe both

EuEd.(EuEd.(Met(u,7)^Met(d,4) ^ EaEbEi.(S(a,d,2)^S(b,u,6)^Intr(i,(u,5),(d,1)) ^ Ex.C(x,a,b)))) -> Ex.P(x)

there is the u line (7 stops), and the d line (4 stops). a 
commuter wants to get from (d,2) to (u,6). you can transfer
between lines at ((u,5)(d,1)). this imples that it is 
possible for the commuter to get from (d,2) to (u,6)
