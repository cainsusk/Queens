=================
INTRO TO STATS
=================

the course is about probabilities and patterns.

statsistics is just a way of reinventing everyday thinking,
looking at mundane things and finding someting interesting within them.

statistics never answers questions, it gets you the data to answer them someway else.

statistical methods are just a refinement of everyday thinking.


what is a pattern?
---------------------
patterns dont exist without probability (P);
statistics only shows you data which may have PATTERNS that can help extrapolate a conclusion;

RAW_DATA = SIGNAL + RNDM_NOISE;
for exaple, our weight changes very sparratically and creates alot of noise in our weight data.
we can smooth out the noise to find the SIGNAL / interesting data in the raw data;


varibility
-----------
nearly everything has variability.
measuring variability can be important or imparative;

for eample, skin colour, nose shape, etc;
twins have less variability between eachother than siblings, which have less than cousins, etc;

'if you have something to hide, just give them the data'
an acception to variability is of course: the mortality rate is 100%;


lurking variables
---------------------
is a variable which has an important effect on the study which is not included among the variables studied;

we assume alot of stuff without actually checking if its right;


operational definition
---------------------------
'what is average intelegence'
is an example of a question whos answer is an operational definition of average intelegence;
when collecting data it is very important to define all terms you use to describe the data


descriptive stats
--------------------
centered around the visualization of data;

showing data in order to see new information about it


inferential stats
---------------------
making estmates/decisions about a POPULATION (the set of data containing all possible or hypothetical observations of a given phenomenon)
based on the study of a sample of that population.

ie. finding the average man by measuring a sample of men in a country etc.


categorical data
--------------------
data that gives a # to individuals or mutually exclusive categories
Single=1
Married=2
etc...


nominal data
----------------
data that gives a name or # to individuals or mutually exclusive categories
this is essentially numeric data when you use #'s;
but not arithmatic operators are valid in nominal data;


mutually exclusive
-----------------------
venn diagrams
	not exclusive - (A()B) 
	mutually exclusive - (A)(B)

for example, if your pulling cards from a deck, pulling a spade and pulling a heart are mutually exclusive because you cannot do both at the same time


numerical data
-------------------
NOMINAL data
	see above	

ORDINAL data
	mutually exclusive
	fixed order (ie. letter grades A B C..)
	
INTERVAL data
	mutually exlusive
	fixed order
	equal spacing between categories (ie. 1m + 1m = 2m; B + B != C)

RATIO data
	mutually exclusive
	fixed order
	equal spacing
	an absolute 0 point (height, weight, area, etc.)

DICHOTOMOUS data
	data with 2 settings:
	on, off
	0, 1
	m, f
	just we can dichotomize data doesnt mean we should


DATA PROPERTIES
==================
in stats we care about 3 properties of data:
	location
	shape (bell-shaped, skewed, bimodal, etc.)
	variability (spreadout)

raw data gives you nothing, you must apply yourself to it

plotting data can help you find the location and shape of the data:
below is a dot plot

	             o    }-general shape
	      o     oo    }/
	o    o   oooo o o      o                   o  <--- outlier (variability)

stem and leaf diagram
=====================
a 'new' way to show data.
it takes each # in a dataset and removes the last digit while perserving the first portion. all numbers with the same first portion are grouped together, represented by their individual last digit
for example:

N = 80 (number of data values (not actually 80))
leaf unit: 1.0 
STEM	LEAF
7	6
8	7
9	7
10	5 1
11	5 8 0
12	5 0 3
13	4 1 3 5 3 5
14	2 9 5 8 3 1 6 9
15	4 7 1 3 4 0 8 8 6 8 6 8 0 8
16	9 6 7 3 1
17	3 4 9 2
18	2 3 	= 182 183
19	2 2 	= 192 192
20	0

where the stem is the first portion of the number and the leaf is the last digit

they can also have frequency distrubution column, though you already see the frequency in the display
computers may also order the leafs on each stem to further see patterns;
can also have multiple stems for the same first portion which contains leafs < 5 and > 5

MALE	stem	FEMALE
7 6 	1	9 7 4
3 4 4	2	6 9 1 2 4 4 5 6
1 2 2	3	1 2 4 3 
2 1	4	5 6 
1	5	9


frequency distrubutions
=====================
we first must decide how many 'bins' or classes we will categorize our data with

choose the classes (usually 5-15)
	largest_class_val - smallest_class_val = range
	range is used to find the approximate the # of classes

	range / approx_#_of_classes = approx_class_interval
	the class interval is the difference between 2 classes, the width of the class

	one must examine the data to get definitive class intervals / class boundaries (the location of the class boundry rather than the width of the class)
	do this by sorthing or talling the data and counting the # of elem. in each class

	A RULE:
		for datasets < 200, sqrt(n) = #_of_classes

EXAMPLE
--------------
max		= 245
min 		= 76
range 		= 245 - 76 = 169
n 		= 80	
classes		= sqrt(n) = 8.944 ~= 9
class interval 	= 169 / 9 = 18.777

using class interval of 20

70   <= x  < 90
90   <= x  < 110
110 <= x  < 130

start the first class at 70 (would use 9 bins w/ given interval and dataset)
many other schemes would be fine too

cumulative frequency
---------------------------
is the freqency up to a class, so if the first class has a freq. of 1 and the second class had freq. of 2, the cum. freq. of class 2 would be 3


relative frequency
-----------------------
relative frequency is the frequency of a class divided by the number of data points n
the display for frequency and relative frequency are the same

cumulative relative frequency
-------------------------------------
same as cum. freq. but it is also relative (divided by n)


histogram
---------------
is a bar graph that shows data relative to time.
can also represent data relative to other things but isnt called a histogram.
ie. FREQUENCY DISTRUBUTION DATA

		+
	 	+
	+	+

frequency polygon
---------------------------
the shape created by drawing a point from each top of the bar of a historam to the next to create a line

	   /--------\
	  /	+    \
	 /	+     \
	+	+      \
	+	+       \-
	--------------------

pareto diagrams
------------------------
are bar charts with categories listed in the same order as their frequencies
ordered bar diagram

	+
	+	
	+	+
	+	+
	+	+	+
	------------------
	1	2	3


the pareto diagram can have a pareto relationship. the above diagram does not show it.

	+	+	+
	------------------
	1	2	3

this pareto diagram DOES show the pareto relationship
that is, there is a bar (1) that dominates the graph

pareto relationship
--------------------
a relationship where one or a small # of classes have the majority of the data / signal

for example, 1.7% of watches are sold from switzerland, but 58% of the money made from selling watches is made in switzerland
this is a pareto relationship


two way frequency distrubution
-------------------------------
for example, count the number of undergraduate and graduate students, male and female.
thus a datapoint will be in 2 distingct classes (undergrad, male, etc.)
ie.

this is known as an R x C table (r by c)

relative frequency of m/f, grad/undergrad students
note: rel. freq. is equivalent to probability (P)
		grad	und.grad	total
	f	0.32	0.16		0.48
	m	0.12	0.40		0.52

	total	0.44	0.56		1.00

everything in the total row and column are known as marginal probabilities
everything else is known as joint probabilities


pie charts
----------
bad:
use bar charts


##

bias
-----
biased estamator tend on the low or high side
they can fuck up your data but if you know the bias, you can account for it

most people consier themselves above average, which is a contradiction to above average
people are just biased towards themselves

search engines can also be biased, same with AI etc.


data summary and display
========================
n	 = sample size
N	 = population size
                             
sample mean
-----------                                          	  _                                                       _
if the observations in sample size n are x1, x2, ..., xn the sample mean (x, x bar) of the sample is:
	_
	x = (SUM(xn) / n)

the convetion is to represent all datasets where n > 30 with 2 decimal places, 
and everything else with 1 decimal place
people will snigger if you dont do this

		sample mean 
		  |
	          |   o      
	      o   | oo    
	o    o   oooo o o      o                 o  
	------------------------------------------
	1	2	3	4	5	6

the sample mean can be seen as the balance point or centre of gravity of the data values


finding the mean of population containing N elements
----------------------------------------------------

MU = SUM(xN) / N
	    _
both MU and x are arithmatic means, meaning they are averages (SUM(elem) / NUM_ELEM)


important jargon
-----------------

STATISTIC
	a characteristic of a sample is called a statistic (x bar is a stat)
	what we know

PARAMETER
	a parameter is a charachteristic of a population (MU is a parameter)
	what we want to know

MEAN
	refers to arithmatic mean (sample and popultion mean, etc.)

POPULATION
	the complete set of all datapoints, real and hypothetical

SAMPLE
	a portion of a populaton

MEAN
----
is very reliable but outliers can cause the mean to do some not very average things.
they can cause the mean to be unrepresentative of the overall data

you can rectify this by presenting the mean w/ or w/out the outliers

although most of the time, the mean or 'average' of smething doesnt actually exist in the wild

CALCULATOR - enter_data
	mode;

	enter in datapoints to x column;
	AC;

CALCULATOR - find_mean

		3;
		2;


weighted mean
-------------
the mean calculated with ech elem (x) having a weight (w)
	_
	x_w = SUM(w*x) / SUM(w) 

we can do this with a freq, distrubution by using the bins as (x) and the number of elem in the bins (w)

CALCULATOR - enter_weighted_data
	if freq_column_off:
		shift;
		setup;
		d-pad down;
		4; - STAT
		ON;
	{enter_data}


grand mean of combined data
---------------------------
to find the grand mean of combined data we just find the weighted mean of all the data with the weights being the sample size and (x) being the means from each of the samples
		_		 _
	s	x	n	nx
	1	2.32	13	30.55
	2	2.15	21	52.71
	3	2.29	16	36.64
	total		50	119.9


	=
	x (x bar bar) = 119.9 / 50 = 2.398

this can be dont with {find_mean} and {enter_weighted_data}


MEDIAN
------
to find the median you mist first order the data from smalles to largest

the median is the value of the middle number 	when n is odd, 
and the mean of the 2 middle numbers 		when n is even

the index of the median is:
	i_median = (n+1)/2

sorted vals	1 3 5 23 77
i_median	1 2 3 4  5

the most common symbol for the sample median is:
	~
	x (x tilde)


the median is better at estimating the representative average of SKEWED data, which mean is bad at it.

the median is much more stable


fractile
--------
dividing data into n-tile parts.
the median is a fractile, it splits data in half (2 parts)

just like the median there is no formula for the fractile, 
but if the data is ordered, there is a formula for finding the index value of the fractile

	covert the fractile youre consudering into the equiv. percentile
	to find the index of the Pth percetile use the formula:

		i_pthPercentile = (p*(n + 1) / 100)

	for reference, if we were trying to find the median, p=50

	once we have the index (i),
	if the i is an integer		then the fractile is at index i
	if the i is a x+float		then the fractile = (data[x] + (float*(data[x+1] - data[x]))

EXAMPLE - finding Q1

	i_25percentile = (25*(n + 1) / 100) = i + float

	25percentile   = data[x] + float(data[x+1] - data[x]) 
	
		       = 30.5


EXAMPLE - finding IQR

	IQR = Q3 - Q1

	(measure of variability)

	Q3 = i_75percentile = x+float

	75percentile = data[x] + float*(data[x+1] - data[x]) 

	IQR = Q3 - Q1


5 number summary
----------------
	min
	Q1
	median
	Q3
	max


box & whiskers diagram
---------------------
the box plot is used to display the 5 num summary

	      median
		|
	min Q1  |  Q3   max   outlier
	|   |   |  |     |      |
	----[===|==]------      x
	=========================
	1	2	3	4
            ^^^^^^^^
	       IQR
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	     range

anything greater than 1.5*IQR is defined in a boxplot as an outlier.
the smallest value not an oulier is the min and vice versa for max

very useful for comparing the location, variability, and shape of datasets

to create a boxplot:
	calculate 5 num summary
	construct uniform scale
	construct box from Q1-Q3 and indicate median
	chaeck for presence of outliers using IQR
	locate ouliers, if present, and draw whiskers to the ost extreme dta values which are not outliers


MODE
----
the mode or modal value of a dataset is the most frequently occuring value in said dataset

not all datasets have a mode, and some have more than one

the mode is esspecially useful with categorical data

	[
	[		[
	[		[
	[		[
	[	[	[
	[	[	[
	-----------------
	A	B	O

this plot is bimodal


shapes of distrubution
----------------------
symmetrial
	self explanatory
normal
	symmetric and mound shaped
bimodal
	distrubution in 2 modes
skewed 
	asymmetric distrubution pulled to one direction
	negative skew - right skew
	positive skew - left  skew

we can use a boxplot to infer the shape of distrubution 


kurtosis
--------
the measure of how normal a 'mound shape' / curve is


grouped data
============
classe are the same in grouped data as they are in freq. distrubutions,
accept they are defined as a range rather than starting digits

class limits
------------
class limits are the endpoints of our classes:

	bins		freq.
	00 - 24		x
	25 - 49		y
	50 - 74		z
	75 - 99		w


class boundaries 
----------------
given the limits above, the boundaries would be:

	00.5 - 24.5
	25.5 - 49.5
	50.5 - 74.5
	75.5 - 99.5

because class boundries ALWAYS end with the digit 5 and always have 1 more place to the decimal than the data
in our example, the class limits and data are to 0 places of the decimal 


class mark
----------
the midpoint of each class

	if C is a class and lM and lm were the max and min of C, then midpoint M = lM - lm


finding approx. median of grouped data
--------------------------------------
	class		class mark	freq	cum.freq

	00.0 - 24.9	12.45		5	5
	25.0 - 49.9	37.45		13	18
	50.0 - 74.9	62.45		16	34
	75.0 - 99.9	87.45		8	42
	100.0-124.9	112.45		6	48

total					48

	i_median = (48+1)/2 = 24.5

using i_median we can determine that the median is in 50.0-74.9 because,

	18 < i_median < 34 

thus it is in bin 3 if counting from 1

thus the formula is:
	_	
	x ~= L + (j/f)*c


	L: lower BOUNDARY of the class i_median falls into 
	f: frequency of said class
	c: class interval of said class (the difference between the lower bound of said bin minus the lower bound of the bin prior)
	j: i_median minus cum.freq of bin prior to said bin


so to find the 80th percentile of the data:
	i_80percentile 	= 39.2
	L 		= 74.9
	f		= 8
	j		= 39.2-34 = 5.2
	c		= 25.0
		       _
	80percentile / x ~= 74.9 + (5.2/8)*25 = 91.2


range
-----
the range of a dataset is the (max - min)


deviation
---------     	 _
deviation = xi - x

for deviation and vaiance, use 3 significant digits


sample variance
---------------	     _
	s^2 = SUM(xi-x)^2 / (n-1)
is the sample variance

STANDARD DEVIATION is +sqrt(s^2) = s

the sum of all std deviations of a sataset always = 0

for deviation and vaiance, use 3 significant digits

CALCULATOR - find_std_devition
	shift;
	mode;
	3;
	1;
	enter data into x column;
	if freq_column_on:
		fill the column w/ 1s;
	AC;

	shift;
	1;
	4;
	4;
	=;

	if want_standard_variance
		ans^2;
		=;


population variance
-------------------
the population vairance of a population of size N is:
	
	SIGMA^2 = SUM(xi - MU)^2 / N

reminder: MU = population mean

sqrt(SIGMA^2) = SIGMA = population deviation
	

chebyshevs theorum
------------------
for any dataset and any constant k < 1, the proportion of the data that must lie within k standard deviations AT least.

	1 - (1/k^2)
	
sya we are given data where mean=20, std.dev=2, what can we say about the data that falls between 16 and 20

	    6        6
	<-------||------->
	==================
	14	20	26

6 = 3 * std.deviation, therefore k = 3

and thus, the proportion of data that falls between 16 & 20 is:

	1 - (1/3^2) = 1-(1/9) = 9/8

therefore at lest 8/9 / 88.9% of the data falls between 14 and 26


empirical rule
--------------
for any MOUND-SHAPE data set

	approx. 68.0% of data falls within 1 std. deviation of the mean

	approx. 95.0% of data falls within 2 std. deviatons of the mean

	approx. 99.7% of data falls within 3 std. deviatons of the mean

to use the rule, find what std.dev is and then 1=68, 2=95, 3=99.7 is the percentage of values which are within [1,2,3] std.deviation


Z-score
-------
the distance that a value deviates from the mean in terms of units of standard deviation

sample		 _
	z = (x - x) / s

population
	x = (x - MU) / SIGMA

the distrubution of Z scores is the same as that of the raw data
the also have the same shape as the raw data
Z-scores allow you to compare scores from different distrubutions

EXAMPLE
what is the Z-score of an IQ of 125
uses population because we are dealing w all IQ ever, mean of IQ = 100, std.dev = 15)

	Z = (x - MU) / SIGMA = (125-100)/15 = 1.67


OUTLIER
=======
a value with a |Z-score| > 3 is considered to be an outlier


coefficient of variation
------------------------
sample            _
	CV = (s / x)*(100%)

population
	CV = (SIGMA / MU)*(100%)

EXAMPLE - c.std.dev = 1.22, i.std.dev = 23.88

	c.CV = (1.22/12.2)*(100%) 	= 10%
	i.CV = (23.88/408.44)*(100%)	= 5.8%

therefore, despite what the std.dev showed, c has more variation than i


finding variance, std.dev of grouped data
------------------------------------------------
CALCULATOR - find _std_dev_grouped
	{find_std_deviation}


pearson coefficient of skewness
===============================
in general SK will fall between -3 and +3

	SK = 3(mean - median) / std.dev

if the data is symmetric, SK = 0

remember: kurtosis tells us what kind of mound shaped curve we have 
the pearson skewness coefficient tells us which way the curve is skewed if its NOT mound shaped

EAXMPLE

	x	f	cum.f

	5	3	3
	7	2	5
	9	2	7

~
x   = 7		-median because (cum.f) 3 < i_index < 5
       _ ~
SK = 3(x-x)/s = 3(7.625-7)/3.068 = 0.0611
SK = 0.0611 is a positive skew (left skew)


######################
inferential statistics
######################

multiplication rule
-------------------
if we  have 2 choices (m,n options) in a row that affet eachother, then the number of ways they can be done is m*n ways

you can choose a pen or pencil which is red, blue, or green, thus there are 2*3 = 6 ways to make these choices


permutations
------------
the number of r objects being selected from a set of n distinct objects
cares about the order in which they are chosen ie: 1,2 /= 2,1

	n_P_r

permuting r objects out of n objects

EXAMPLE

choose 4 students from 80 to be pres., vice.pres., sec., tresurer, , the order matters

	80_P_4 = 37957920

CALCULATOR - permutation
	enter n;
	shift;
	times;
	enter r;
	=;

combinations
------------
the number of r objects being selected from a set of distingct objects n
combinations do NOT care about the order which they are chosen ie: 1,2 = 2,1
'combination' of elements, implies that ordering doesnt matter

	n_C_r

	(n->r)

CALCULATOR - combination
	enter n;
	shift;
	divided;
	enter r;
	=;


classical probability
---------------------
	P(S) = S/n 
if n is the number of possibilities
and S is a possibility

EAMPLE

there are 5 men and 8 women

if a group of 4 is chosen out of this group,
what is the P(2 are women, 2 are men)

5_C_2	8_C_2
=10	=28

10*28 = 280 # of ways we can choose 2 men & 2 women

thus the probability of this occuring is:

	
	P(280) = 280/(13_C_4) = 0.392

this is whats known as a HYPERGEOMETRIC distrubution whith the 3 C functions:
	P = (5_C_2)*(8_C_2)/(13_C_4)


relative frequecy in terms of probability
-----------------------------------------
relative frequency is equivalent to probability


law of large numbers
--------------------
the proportion of success will tend to approach the probability that any one outcome will be a success in INDEPENDENT trials
essentially meaning, if you run an experiment long enough, you could prove anything and thus, nothing	


gamblers fallacy
----------------
basically, previous outcomes dont affect future outcomes in independent events
ie. rolling 100 1's in a row doesnot change the probability of then rolling any given number


experiment
----------
a process ehich can have one of several possible outcomes


sample space
------------
a list of all possible outcomes in an experiment


event
-----
is a subset of the sample space
a collection of one or more points in the sample space and the null set denoted by PHI
coin toss {h}{t}
die roll {1,2,3}{6}{6,6}


compliment
----------
the compliment of an even is all samplespace outside of the event
event 		= A
complement	= A' / NOT A


venn diagram
------------
sample space is represented by a square with circles within it that represent events,
within the events there are points in the sample space

		C is only points in both A and B

	UNION
		C = A U B
		C is points all points in A and B 


mutually exclusive (MX)
-----------------------
A and B are mutually exclsive if, on a venn diagram, they have no overlap or [A cap B = PHI]


postulates of probability
=========================

probabilities are positive real #s for any event A P(A)>=0

every sample space has a probability P(S)=1

P(PHI) = 0

P(A) + P(A') = 1


MX addition rule
----------------

if A and B are MX then P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
	if k events are mutually exclusive then the the probability that 1 of them will occur is the sum of their individual P
	P(A1 U A2 U ... U An) = P(A1) + P(A2) + ... + P(An)


odds
----
if the probility of an event is P the odd for its occurence are A to B, where A and B are positive ints such that

	a/b = p/(1-p)

where p	= probability event will occur
    1-p	= probability event will not occur


GENERAL addition rule
---------------------
assuming A & B are not MX
	P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A I B)

EXAMPLE

pick one card that is red or a face card

P(R) = 26/52
P(F) = 12/52
P(R I F) = 6/52 
P(R U F)= P(R) + P(F) - P(R I F)
        = 26/52+ 12/52- 6/52
	= 0.615

professor charles worked with henry II, goat major


conditional probability
-----------------------
the probability of A, given B has already happened

	P(A|B)

the probability that A happens when we know that B has already happened

can also be thought of as the the sample space is now B, and any part of A in B is an event within B: P(A|B)

if P(B) /= 0 then:

	P(A|B) = P(A I B) / P(B)

EXAMPLE

we pick one card, what is the P that the card is a queen, given if the card selected is known to be a face card

P(F) 	= 12/52
P(Q) 	= 4/52					      _
P(Q|F) 	= P(Q I F)/P(F) = (4/52)/(12/52) = 4/12 = 0.333

P(Q I F) is 4/52 because the only time a card can be a face and queen is if its a queen thus P(Q I F) = P(Q)


independence
------------
if:
	P(Q) = P(Q|R)

then Q and R are independent
thus meaning the occurence or non occurence of Q does not change the P that R will occur and visa versa.


INDEPENDENT multiplication rule
-------------------------------
if events A and B are independent then:
	P(A I B) = P(A)*P(B)


GENERAL multiplication rule
---------------------------
P(A I B) = P(B)P(A|B) or P(A)P(B|A)


Bayes' Theorum
==============

P(A|B) = [P(B|A)P(A)] / [(P(B|A)P(A)) + (P(B|A')P(A'))]

when using Bayes' Law, if the question is P(A|B), one must be given P(B|A)


Bayes' Law w/ tree diagram

assuming A is having aids and T is testing positive for Aids

5  (0.005) people tested positive who HAVE aids

74 (0.074) people tested poditive who DONT have aids

79 people test positive total

thus:
	the probability that someone has aids then tests positive for it 
	[P(T|A)] is 5/79 = 6% of people who test positive actually have Aids


success
-------
success refers to the occurence of an event which we are counting
it is easier to count the success of the less likely thing when measuring 'success'

EXAMPLE

if we choose 3 people, what is the probability that AT LEAST ONE of them is left handed [P(L)=0.1, P(R)=0.9]
would equal the compliment of the probability of choosing 3 right handed people:

	P(x) probability that x people are left handed
	P(0) 	= 0.9^3 	= 0.729
	P(>=1) 	= 1 - 0.729 	= 0.271	= 27.1% chance of choosing at least 1 person whos left handed

EXAMPLE

if a person engages in unsafe seual activity with 100 people, what is the P that the person contracts a diseas atleast once

	P(atleast 1 infection) = 1 - P(0 infections)
	= 1 - 0.99^100
	= 0.634
	= 63.4%


expectation
-----------
like from CISC203:

	E(xn) = SUM(wn*xn)

where xis probabilities with their respective w's


relative risk
-------------
given P_control and P_treatment, which represent the probability of something happening without and with inducing it respectively

relative_risk = P_treatment / P_control

absolute risk
-------------
idk i guess its just risk, no funny business


dicrete random variables
------------------------
variables that can only take on certain values

a variable that is determined by the outcome of a random experiment

a discrete random variable assumes a finite number of values or a countable infinity

EXAMPLE
	the number of people in a room (cannot be a float, must be int)

	the nunber of 5's rolled after rolling a die 20 times (must be an int, can only be <=20)

to remember:
	when COUNTING, use a DISCRETE random variable

continuious random variables
----------------------------
areise when we deal with quantities measured on a continuious scale

EXAMPLE
	height

	amnt of alcohol in someones blood

to remember:
	when MEASURING, use CONTINUIOUS ramdom variable


probability distrubutions
-------------------------
suppose we did a survey of 2000 families about car ownership

	# cars	f	relative.f
	x		P(x)
	0	30	0.015
	1	470	0.235
	2	850	0.425
	3	490	0.245
	4	160	0.08

	SUM	2000	1

the relative frequency must sum to be 1 as they are probabilities


random variables
-----------------
X is a random variable, it is used to to count or measure events that occur


binomial distrubution
=====================
the probability of getting x successes in n independent trials is:

	P(X=x)

where we are given [n=samplesize], [x=target], [p=P(x)]

the binomial distrubution is discrete

discrete probability distrubutions are thought of as theoretical populations and should be treated as a population when finding std.dev etc.

	0	0.0000

	2	0.0071
	3	0.0356
	4	0.1205
	5	0.2939
	6	0.5400	
	7	0.7794
	8	0.9323
	9	0.9902
	10	1.0000

P(X>6):

we can now use the cum.dist function to find the P that x > 6
	P(X>6) = 1 - P(X <= ?)		the 1 is the probability that x <= 10, which is certain

using a katie-mcdoanald diagram:
		    ->
	1 2 3 4 5 6 | 7 8 9 10
		    ->
we can see that we want X to equal the values 7,8,9,10

thus, if 1 is the total P and P(X<=6) is the probability of choosing a number 6 or less,
therefore:
	
	P(X > 6) = 1 - P(X <= 6)

and thus we have used P(X<=x) to solve P(X>x)

P(X>=4):

using the kaie-mcdoanald diagran
	      ->
	1 2 3 | 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
	      ->
we can see that we must subtract P(X >= 3) from 1, 
thus,
	P(X>=4) = 1 - P(X >= 3)
	        = 1 - 0.0356

P(4<X<8):

diagram:	->     <-
	1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 | 8 9 10
		->     <-
because were dealing with 2 bounds instaed of 1 we subtract the upper bound from the lower bound rather than 1 (upperbound) minus lower bound.
thus,
	P(4 < X < 8) = P(X<=7) - P(X<=4)
		     = 0.7794  - 0.1205

P(2<=X<6):

diagram:  ->       <-
	1 | 2 3 4 5 | 6 7 8 9 10
	  ->       <-

thus:
	P(2 <= X < 6) = P(X<=5) - P(X<=1)


hypergeometric distrubutuion
============================
if n objects are to be selected WITHOUT REPLACEMENT from a set of a objects of one kind (SUCCESS), and b objects of another kind (FAILURE).
the probability of observing x successes is:

	P(X=x) = f(x) = ((a_C_x)(b_C_[n-x]))/[a+b]_C_n

there are many situations which are hypergeometric but we can (and will) treat as binomial 
	if and only if n < (a+b)*0.05

for example, if we were ot take the propability of choosing 10 queens students at random that 5 would be men and 5 be women 
	a=2766	b=1891	a+b=4657	n=10	x=5
here we can see that n, the sample is < 5% of a+b, meaning that we can do a binomial distrubution rather than hypergeometric
	hypergeometric solution - 0.206
	binomial       solution - 0.206

EXAMPLE

if 5 people are chosen out of 10 women and 18 men, what is the probability that the group consists of 2 women and 3 men

we will consider [women = SUCCESS] and [men = FAILURE] as there are less women to count if true then men

n=5	a=10	b=18	a+b=28	x=2	n-x=3

	P(X=x) = f(x)	= (10_C_2)(18_C_3)/(28_C_5)
			= 0.374


poisson distrubution
====================
where LAMBDA is the expected or mean number of occurences in a given interval, and x is the number of successes observed
is DISCRETE like binomial distrubution

	P(X=x) = (e^[-LAMDBA] * LAMBDA^x) / x!

in a binomian situation with n large and p small, the shape of the distrubution approaches the equivakent poisson distrubution.
thus, if:
	n >= 100 and np < 10
	
	P(X=x) ~= f(x) = (e^[-np] * np^x) / x!

where np = n*p from the binomial distrubution

CALCULATOR - poisson_distribution
	shift;
	mode;
	dpad down;
	3;
	dpad down;
	if poission_pd [P(X=x)]:
		2;
	if poission_cd [P(X<=x)]:
		3;

EXAMPLE

if one is expecting 3 calls in an hour, what is the probability of observing exactly 4 calls in an hour

	LAMBDA = 3 (per hour)
	x      = 4 (in an hour)

	P(X=4) = (e^-3 * 3^4) / 4!
	P(X=4) = 0.168


expected value of probability distrubution
------------------------------------------
we use MU because we consider the probability distrubution to be a population from which we are sampling when we observe a random variable:
	MU = E(x) = SUM(x * f(x))
where f(x) is the probility of x

EXAMPLE

let X be the number of bits recieved in error whin the next 4 bits transmitted
thus the possible values of X are [0,1,2,3,4]. suppose the P(X) are:
	0:	0.6561
	1:	0.2916
	2:	0.0486
	3:	0.0036
	4:	0.0001
find the expected number of bits recieved in error
	MU = E(X) = SUM(x*f(x))
	     E(X) = 0*f(0)+...+4*f(4)
	     E(X) = 0.400


variance and standard deviation of discrete probability distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------
variance
	SIGMA^2 = SUM((x - MU) * f(x))

std.dev
	SIGMA   = sqrt(SIGMA^2)


mean and variance of binomial distrubution
------------------------------------------
mean
	MU = n*p
variance
	SIGMA^2 = n*p(1-p)



normal distrubution
===================
a syymetrical mound shaped 'normal' distrubution

a normal distrubution has 2 PARAMETERS (cause is pseudo population)
	MU 	= mean
	SIMA	= std.dev	(variance = SIGMA^2)

furthermore:
	X ~ N(MU, SIGMA^2)
means that X is a normal distrubution with MU and SIGMA as mean & std.dev

thus if we have X~N(0, 1), and we added 1 to the mean [0+1=1, N(1, 1)] it would transpose the distrubution 1 unit to the right
similarly, changing the variance will change the height and width proportionally

	when i moved from BC to Ontario i raised the avg. IQ of both provinces

	enter CD upper bound;

the normal density function
---------------------------

	f(x) = (1 / (SIGMA*sqrt(2*pi))) * e^[(-1/2)*((x-MU)/SIGMA)^2]


the normal distrbution function
-------------------------------

	P(x1<=x2) = 1 / sqrt(2*pi*SIGMA) * INTEGRAL^[x2]_[-infty](e^[-(x2-MU)^2 / 2*SIMA^2] * dx1)


standardization formula
-----------------------
after calculating:
	z = (x - MU) / SIGMA

if X is normally distrubuted then:
	f(z) = (1 / sqrt(2*pi)) * e^[-(z^2 / 2)]
is always true

the Z-curve is created using the above equation as a function

	    [	[   [

normal approximation of binomial
================================
given a binomial (always discrete):
	n=50	p=0.10	MU=np=5	SIGMA=sqrt(np(1-p))=2.12

we can approximate the normal curve using these MU and SIGMA like
	X~N(MU, SIGMA^2)

if we were to just say:
	P(X_d < 2) ~= P(X_c < 2)
it would be close but not quite:


corrction for continuity
------------------------
correct for continuity we basically add or subtract 0.5 to x to make [X_c<=x] closer to [X_d<=x] 
thus,
	P(X_d < 2) ~= P(X_c < 2.5)


###################################
sampling and sampling distrubutions
###################################


samples from groups
-------------------
there is some group we are interested in:
	families in canada
	ducks in norway
	santa-clause impersonators in russia
	Soap from the ganonoque soap factory

we are interested in a random variable regarding this population:
	INCOME OF FAMILIES IN CANADA
	INCOME OF DUCKS IN NORWAY
	WEIGHT OF SANTA CLAUSES IN RUSSIA
	HEIGHT OF SOAP FROM GANONOQUE

all the information regarding a quantity in a group is contained in its distrubution function
although real world distribution functions are particularly complicated
in real life we know nothing of the distribution functions of the variables we are interested in

because of this we tend to focus on certain aspects of the dist.func:
	MEAN income
	MEAN income
	RATE of obesity
	PERCENT of soap in canada


estimation of means
-------------------
	    _
when we use x as an estimator of MU, the probability is (1-a)*100% that the estimate will be off by AT MOST:
	E = z_[a/2] * (SIGMA / sqrt(n))

we use this if the poulation os normally distributed or if we have a sample >= 30 
	in which case, s estimates SIGMA
							     _
using the value E, we can say with 99% confidence that [MU = x +- E]
	    _	       _   
	OR [x-E < MU < x+E]
which thus gives us our confidence interval for that value of MU


CONFIDENCE INTERVAL small sample
================================
that is, when [n < 30]


the t distribution
------------------
if we have reason to believe that the population were sampling is normally distrubuted (or at least mound shaped),
we can approximate it with the t.dist
the x axis is values of a/2
the y axis is values of degrees of freedom	- degrees of freedom (d.f) = [n-1] 

the table will be on the exam

the last row of the table are the z values for 

EXAMPLE

given sample:
	14.26, 16.78, 13.65, 11.53, 11.56, 12.64, 13.37, 15.60, 14.94

we know that:
	n = 8
	a = 1-0.95 = 0.05
we can calculate:
	_
	x = 14.096	-mean
	s = 1.675	-std.dev
	df= 7		-degrees of freedom

thus, t_[x,y] is:
	t_[a\2, df]
	t_[7, 0.025] = 2.365	(from table)


CHI^2 distribution
------------------
pretty much th same as t.dist accept w/ different table

the confidence interval for CHI^2 is:

	((n-1)s^2)/(CHI^2_[a/2]) < SIGMA^2 < ((n-1)s^2)/(CHI^2_[1-(a/2)])

EXAMPLE

from earlier:
	14.26, 16.78, 13.65, 11.53, 11.56, 12.64, 13.37, 15.60, 14.94
	n=8
	s=1.675

we can then calculate:
	df	= 7
	a 	= 0.05
	a/2	= 0.025
	1 - a/2	= 0.975

thus we must find on the table:
	CHI_[df, a/2]	=16.013	(1)
	CHI_[df, 1-a/2]	=1.690	(2)

now, to find the confidence interval using the above formula:
	((7)(1.675)^2)/(16.013) < SIGMA^2 < ((7)(1.675)^2)/(1.690)

	1.226 < SIGMA^2 < 11.621
	with ((1-0.05)*100)% confidence
	with 95%	     confidence

	1.107 < SIGMA < 3.409 


CONFIDENCE INTERVAL large sample
================================
that is, when [n >= 30]

the formula for SIGMA in a large sample is:
	SIGMA = 1 +- (s / (1 + Z_[a/2]))	note Z_[x] = t_[x, bottom]

with ((1-a)*100)% confidence

note, we are assuming the underlying population is normally distributed

EXAMPLE


estimation of proportions
=========================
p = POPULATION proportion

^
p = SAMPLE proportion

	^
	p = x / n	(p cap)

where x is the number of successes in n independent trials

furthermore, as long as [np, n(1-p) >= 5]

	    ^			  ^      ^
	p = p +- (Z_[a/2] * sqrt((p*(1 - p)) / n))

with ((1-a)*100)% confidence


finding sample size
-------------------
when in estimation of proportion situations one may want to find the samle size of the data were dealing with

	    ^   ^
	p = p(1-p) * (Z_[a/2] / E)^2

EXAMPLE

given:
136 successes proportional to 400 trials
	^
	p 	= 136/400 = 0.34
	Z_[a/2]	= 1.96
	E 	= 0.02


what is p?
	p = 0.34(1-0.34) * (1.96 / 0.02)^2
	p = 2155.13

hypothesis tests: INDEPENDENT SAMPLES
#####################################


summary tables
--------------
if we have a situation where one tells another that a coin flipped heads or tails, one must guess if they are lying or not.
we can represent this as a summary table

	 |	choose T	choose F
	-|------------------------------
	T|	correct		ERROR
	F|	ERROR		correct


hypothesis testing
==================
is an assertion or conjecture about a parameter(s) of a populaton(s)


the null hypothesis
-------------------
the null hypothesis is what we assume to be true BEFORE we do analysis
	H_0
the nul.hyp is the hypothesis of no difference or change

never use the phrase 'accept null hypothesis,' instead use 'fail to reject null hypothesis'


the alternative hypothesis
--------------------------
often reffered to as the research hypothesis
the alt.hyp is formulated with the nul.hyp
the alt.hyp is accepted when the nul.hyp is rejected
we write the alt.hyp in 1 of 3 ways:
	H_A: MU /= MU_0
	H_A: MU >  MU_0
	H_A: MU <  MU_0


examples
--------
H_0:	defendant is innocent
H_A:	defendant is guilty
the defendant is presumed inocent until proved guilty


test for mean SMALL SAMPLE - TEST
--------------------------
if [n < 30]
given H_0: MU = MU

	H_0:T	T negative		F positive
	H_0:F	F negative		T positive


type 1 error
------------
when we reject the nul.hyp but it is true


type 2 error
------------
when we accept the nul.hyp but it is false


power / sesitivity
------------------
is the P of correctly accepting the nul.hyp
	the SENSITIVITY of a hypothesis test is (1-b)


specificity
-----------
is the P of correctly accepting the alt.hyp
	the SPECIFICITY of a hypothesis test is (1-a)

the tails enclosed by the lines are the area in which we reject the nul.hyp


level of significance
---------------------
is the P of making a type 1 error which is acceptable by the experimenter
the P which is acceptable must be determined BEFORE examining the data

the academic default is 5% but is not suitable for real world applications

we compare this value to the p value to see if the value is significant

the mean of a pop. is thought to be 45.6 but we believe the mean may be larger. taking a rand. sample of [n=42] we observe a sample mean of [x=46.2] w a sample standard deviation [s=4.15]
is there evidence within 5% significance that we are correct?

because [n>30] we can use the t table to find the Z values
	t_[0.05, bottom] = 1.645

H_0: MU = 45.6
H_A: MU > 45.6

using the equation for z-test from |test for mean LARGE SAMPLE|:
	     _
	z = (x - MU) / (s/sqrt(n))
	z = (46.2 - 45.6) / (4.15/sqrt(42))
	z = 0.86

thus we do not have evidence at 5% level of significance that MU > 45.6 because 


p-value
=======
the p-value of a hypothesis test  corresponds to the lowest level of significance for which the null hypothsis would have been rejected

the p-val is the exact level of significance at which your decision would change

the p-val can be found once we have the z value (like from the example before)

EXAMPLE  _
[n=42]	[x=46.2]  [s=4.15]  [z=0.86]  [a=0.05]

the p-val is the area of the tail enclosed by z:

		    /----------------\
	       /---/		      \-|\		
	      /				| \		
	 ----/				|  \----
	/-------------------------------|-------\
	1	2	3	4	Z_0.86	6

thus the area is:
	P(Z > 0.86) = 0.1949


low p-val
---------
'when the p is low, reject the H_0'


finding b
=========
draw the Z curve for the hyp test and indicate the 0 and crit.values 
	_
add the x scale below the Z scale and locate the hypothsized value of MU below the 0 on the Z scale

find the Z value that corresponds to the NEW value of MU 

locate the new z on the Z scale and draw the NEW curve w/ the mean at the edge of the original graph: N(1, z)

a or a/2 if 2 tailed test is an are of in the original Z curve. b is the are that starts at the same point but is shaded in the other direction (into the new Z)

EXAMPLE

H_0: MU = 45.6
H_A: MU > 45.6
[n=42]  [s=4.51]  [a=0.05]

find the P of a type 2 error if the T value of [MU=47.0]

first we must calculate z, like for finding p-val

	z = (47-45.6) / (4.51/sqrt(42))
	z = 2.012

now that we have z we can calculate P(Z_2nd < 1.645)
given Z_2nd~N(1, 2.012=z)
	P(Z_2nd < 1.645)
	use {normal_cd} with [lower=-4 (MU - 4*SIGMA)]  [upper=1.654 (crit.val)]  [SIGMA=1]  [MU=2.102 (z)]


difference between means SMALL SAMPLE - TEST
-------------------------------------
if [n<30] and H_0: MU = MU1:
	     _
	t = (x - MU_0) / (s/sqrt(n))

EXAMPLE

H_0: MU  = 1.5
H_A: MU /= 1.5
	_
[n=6]  [x=1.533]  [s=0.472]  [a=0.05]

df = 5
t_[df, a/2] = t_[5, 0.025]

thus +-t is the points where we reject the null hypothesis

now, to test if H_A is true to 5% level of significance we must finally calculate t

t = (1.533 - 1.5) / (0.472/sqrt(6))
t = 0.171

0.171 > 0.05 thus there is not enough evidence to show H_A


estimating p-val using t-test
-----------------------------
say we calculated the t-test value for a problem, we can then approximate the p-val for the same problem

[H_A: MU > MU_0]  [t=1.88]  [n=15]

we must approximate the p-val using the t-table 
	locate the row [n - 1]
	locate the col [lvl.significance (default=0.05)]

if the t value isnt on the t-table, find the approximate rows it is contained in
thus,
	t_[?, n-1]
	we can see on the table that 1.88 falls between row 0.05 and 0.025

therefore, all we can say is that 2.5% < p-val < 5%
note this was a 1 tailed test


diiference between means LARGE SAMPLE - TEST
-------------------------------------
if [n>30 && n1>30]
given H_0: MU = MU1
	     _   _
	z = (x - x1) / sqrt((SIGMA^2 / n) + SIGMA1^2 / n1)

OR

given H_0: MU - MU1 = DELTA
	     _   _
	z = (x - x1 - DELTA) / sqrt((SIGMA^2 / n) + SIGMA1^2 / n1)

to find the p-val from an equation like this,
	p-val = 2*P(Z < z)


difference between means SMALL SAMPLE - TEST
-------------------------------------
if [n<30 && n1<30 && SIGMA^2 == SIGMA1^2 && Z=N && Z1=N]
note N=normal
				  _   _
then the sampling distrubution of x - x1 is a t distrubution with [n+n1-2=df] degrees of freedom

MU - MU1 = DELTA
	     _   _
	t = (x - x1 - DELTA) / s_p * ((1/n) + (1/n1))

where sp:
	sp = sqrt(((n-1)*s^2 + (n1-1)*s1^2) / (n+n1-2))

one can use this test (pooled variance t-test) whenever the variances are equal OR, as a rule of thumb, [std.dev < 2*std.dev1] if std.dev is larger than std.dev1

EXAMPLE

the following are random samples from 2 coal mines that represent the heat producint capacity of the coal from each mine
1:	8380	8180	8500	7840	7990
2:	7660	7510	7910	8070	7790

use 5% significance to test if there is a difference between the mean heat producing capacity of these 2 mines

H_0: MU = MU1
H_A: MU/= MU1
	_
[n=5]  [x=8.178]  [s=271.1]
	_
[n1=5] [x1=7.778] [s1=216.8]

       [a=0.05]

	s_p = sqrt(((4)*271.1^2 + (4)*216.8^2) / (8))
	s_p = 245.5

	t = (8.178 - 7.778 - DELTA) / s_p * ((1/n) + (1/n1))
	t = 2.51

now, w/ t we can lookup the p-val on the t-table

	t_[?, n+n1-2]
	t_[?, 8]

on the table, we can see that 2.51 falls between column 0.025 and 0.010 on row 8
thus,
	(2 * 0.010) < p-val < (2 * 0.025)

note: 2* because it is a 2 tailed test so the percentages (bounds) we get from the columns of the t-table


welches t-test
--------------
WE DONT HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS

if the variances of 2 small independent samples are UNEQUAL,
then one must use welches (approximate) t-test


paired data
===========
paired data has 3 rows/columns as there needs to be an extra row to keep track of the pairings

EXAMPLE - difference betwen means
because [n < 30] we are using t-test, if [n > 30], can use z-test 

listed below are the work hours lost from accidents at 10 industrial plants bfore and after a safety program


	plant	before	after	difference

	1	45	36	9
	2	73	60	13
	3	46	44	2
	4	124	119	5
	5	33	35	-2
	6	57	51	6	
	7	83	77	6
	8	34	29	5
	9	26	24	2
	10	17	11	6

a normal probability plot of the differences suggests that the 2 underlyng populations can be reasonably assumed to be mound shaped

we wish to test if the program was effetive:

H_0: MU_d = 0
H_A: MU_d > 0
	 _
[n=10]  [x=5.2]  [s=4.08]  [a=0.05]

next we must calculate t to find p-val
	t = (x - MU_0) / (s/sqrt(n))
	t = 4.03

therefore, from the t-table, the p-val falls in:
	p < 0.5%

which means that there is enough evidence to conclude that the work safety program worked

we must be careful however, when dealing w/ paired data if its not random enough
ie. if we were to test the time it takes 10 different people to each park 2 cars, the car which they drove first would have to be chosen randomly or else our research is tainted by lurking variables


effect size
-----------
the effect size is a quantatative measure of the magnitude of a phenomenon

when the effect size is small, the difference is of no real world consequence
