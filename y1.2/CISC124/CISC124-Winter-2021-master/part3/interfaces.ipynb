    "In Java, an interface name must begin with what is referred to as a *Java letter*. A Java letter includes the characters A-Z, a-z, and for historical reasons the dollar sign `$` and the underscore character `_`; Java letters also include Unicode characters corresponding to letters in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, interface names are written using [upper camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case): The first letter of the interface name is capitalized, the remaining letters of the name are in lowercase except for multi-word class names where each word also begins with a capital letter. For example, the interface name `SortedSet` is used instead of `sortedset`, `Sorted_Set`, `sortedSet` or any other variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining characters in a class name can be made up of any number of Java letters or any *Java digits*. A Java digit includes the digits 0-9 and Unicode characters corresponding to digits in other languages."

    "- `abstract`\n",
    "- `strictfp` (we will not use this modifier in any other notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, the only modifier that is relevant to our purposes is the modifier `public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `public` interface is visible to all other classes and interfaces. The modifier is optional; all top-level interfaces have public access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abstract` modifier is considered obsolete and should no longer be used. All interfaces are considered abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modifier `strictfp` is used to indicate that the methods of the interface are *FP-strict* which forces all floating-point calculations performed inside the class to adhere to the IEEE754 floating-point standards; this guarantees that floating-point calculations will always yield the same result regardless of the computing platform. On modern computing hardware likely to run Java this no longer seems to be an issue; see [this Java Enhancement Proposal](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/306) for some discussion."

Interface static methods are identical to class static methods except that all methods in an interface have public access. Static interface methods are implemented within the interface (thus they have method bodies).\n",

    "**Problem 1** Why is it difficult to make changes to a widely used interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 was the first Java version to allow methods to provide an implementation in an interface through the use of *default* methods. A default method is an interface method that has an implementation. Default methods were added to the Java language because it was realized that many existing interfaces needed new methods to support new features that were to be added to the Java language. If the existing interfaces were updated without default methods then every class that implemented an interface would need to be updated as well; this includes classes created by every Java programmer in world and not just the standard library classes.\n",
