|Question 1

cluster data
------------
we can cluster the given data (wine stuff i think) into [k]
clusters using the [I = kmean(X,k)] function in matlab.

this will output a matrix [I] which contains [k] vectors in which 
the indicies for each cluster are located.

finding score
-------------
Given the Data-Matrix A

the first step is to find the the zero mean of the data,
represented as [M]. 

we will then find the covariance of [A]:
        [ B = 1/(m-1) * M'M ]               NOTE: ' = transpose

then, find the Single Value Decomposition of [B]
        [ B = USV' ]

we can then find the scores of data by doing:
        [ Z = MV ]

where [Z] will contain the scores of the principal components (thats
to say, certain vectors within [E] and/or [V] as [E = V]

reduce dimensions
-----------------
we must first find [C_k] where [k] is the number of dimensions/ranks
the approximation matrix should have (in this case, [k=2]).

We find [C_i {0 < i < k}] using the following equation:
        [ C_i = ∠u_i * s_i * ∠v'_i ]

and once we add all the C: [ {i=1→k}SUM(C_i) ]
we get the closest rank-k approximation of [A]

standardize data
----------------
can use the [Z = zscore(A)] function in MatLab which outputs a
matrix of z-scores for each entriy in A. the z score is the
standardized form of the data.
