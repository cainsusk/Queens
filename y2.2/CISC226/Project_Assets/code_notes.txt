the ant script is contained in insect movement

each inect has 3 sensors for stroring values and radius for pharamones.

you can edit all ants within the ant prefab.

the code is taking the position of the sensor and the position of the ant to then 
dictate direction.


all of the insects have a prefab with a parent and children for sensors and food it's carrying carrying etc.

the Insecthill has the role of producing a specific kind of bug.
they hold the data for the oinsect and insect-solider and can be set to autobuild with a ratio of bugs to soliders.


Pharamones have a different colours which correspont to a different pharamone map (which is a script that handles the 
position of the pharamones. it creates all of the possible pharamones and turns them off and on depending on if they
are placed or not)

there needs to be a higher level of absraction like a queen script in order to implement many hills within a scene.


the food sources are trees (there is a tree script) which stores the drop rate, the prefab for the food, drop radius.
it has a co-routine that instantiates all the trees.

the food just stores the 'value' of food or the ammount in hunger

the GameController controls the gui but should eventually do the pharamone map
