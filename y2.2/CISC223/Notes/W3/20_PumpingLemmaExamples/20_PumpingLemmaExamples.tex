\section*{Example 1}
Given \[L = \{a^{2^m} | m \geq 1\}\]

Show that  $L$ is not regular.
Assume  $L$ is regular and let  $n$ be the constant specified by the Pumping Lemma.\\
We will first consider $k$ such that 
\[2^k>n\;\wedge\;x=a^{2^k}\in L\]

By the Pumping Lemma we can write $x=p\cdot q\cdot r$ where each part satisfies the Pumping Lemma.

Note that $1\leq |q|\leq n<2^k$. 
Which expands to:
\[2^k < | p\cdot q^2\cdot r | < 2^k+2^k=2^{k+1}\]

Thus we have reached a contradiction as in order for a string to be in $L$ it must have a length equal to 
        a power of 2. 
From the equation above, it states that for a language of this form to be regular, it must have a length between $2^k$ and 
        $2^{k+1}$.

Therefore,  $L$ is not regular.

\section*{Example 2}
Given
\[L=\{a^ib^k | 0\leq k\leq i\}\]

We shall prove that this language $L$ is not regular via the Pumping Lemma.
Let $n$ be the constant given by the pumping lemma. 
We shall use the following string $x\in L$ in this proof
\[x=a^nb^n\in L\]
By the Pumping Lemma we can write $x = p\cdot q\cdot r$ where $x$ is any string in  $L$ and the parts satisfy the conditions of the Pumping Lemma.\\
We know that $|p\cdot q|\leq n\;\wedge\;q\neq\epsilon$. This implies that  $q=a^t\;\;\{t\geq 1\}$.\\
Thus we can then derive the following Regex.
\[pq^2r = a^{n+t}b^n\in L\]
\[pq^3r = a^{n+2t}b^n\in L\]
Thus we arrive at no contradiction. 

However, consider the Regex below instead:
\[pq^0r = p\cdot r = a^{n-t}b^n\]

And Thus, we have reached a contradiction as the number of 'a' cannot be less than the number of 'b' in a string

\section*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
        \item We use the Pumping Lemma in order to show that a language is \textit{not} regular
        \item Showing that a language satisfies the Pumping Lemma does \textit{not} imply that the language is regular 
                as there exists non-regular languages that satisfy the Pumping Lemma
        \item if one wants to show that a language is regular, one should produce a Regex or State Diagram for 
                said language
