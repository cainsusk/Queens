\section*{Minimization}
A regular language can be represented by many (very) different Deterministic State Diagrams.
Minimization of a Regex or Non-Deterministic State Diagram is intractable--which is to say there 
        is on efficient algorithm to minimize these.

However, because a regular language has a \textit{unique} DFA with a smallest number of states,
        there is an efficient algorithm to minimize this diagram.

\section*{Distinguishable States}
We must define that two states $p,q$ of a DFA are \textbf{distinguishable}.

If there exists a string  $w$ such that it takes  $p$ to final state and  $q$ to a non-final state; or vice versa.

$p,q$ are \textbf{indistinguishable} if and only if for any string $w$:
 \begin{itemize}
        \item $w$ takes  $p$ to final state
        \item  $w$ takes  $q$ to a final state
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, they are Distinguishable 
\pagebreak


\section*{Idea of Algorithm}
the main operation of the minimization algorithm is to find all pairs of \textbf{distinguishable} states.
The reason for this is that, the only way to verify that any states are distinguishable, one must
        compare 2 states and only 2 states.

Any states that are pairwise indistinguishable can be merged into one state (that is, a pair of states that are indistinguishable).

\section*{Preprocessing for Algorithm}
before performing the minimization algorithm, one must eliminate all states that cannot be reached from the starting state
        by any string.
This is done by using a state reachability algorithm.
